# Fraud-Detection-Using-Clustering-and-Classification
This project explores fraud detection using unsupervised clustering and supervised classification techniques on transactional data. This project was developed as a module submission for the Asah by Dicoding program.
---

## Project Objectives :
- Identify potential fraud patterns using clustering techniques  
- Build classification models to predict fraudulent transactions  
- Apply dimensionality reduction and model tuning to improve performance  

---

## Methods & Models Used

### Clustering
- K-Means Clustering  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  

### Classification
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  

### Model Optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning for classification models
